          We are an advertising website in which any entity can advertise its
          goods, profession, craft, special occasion, or simply anything that
          the advertiser deems worth being promoted.You may think of us as a
          large exhibition space that each advertiser rents a space of, and the
          user passes through all then decides what is worth buying , buyer
          communicates with the advertiser directly and deals with it outside
          the site, meaning that the we are not a part of any buying or selling
          process and does not interfere in it in any way.
