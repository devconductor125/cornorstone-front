          We do not accept any responsibility for any user content. If you
          upload or post any content to our services, we are entitled to assume,
          and you are promising to us, that you have the right to do that, and
          that you have the right to allow us to use that content in the way we
          have set out in this user agreement. You must ensure that any content
          that you upload or post does not break any of the rules about your
          conduct below. We can use user content. User content does not become
          our property unless uploaded to our channels or servers, by uploading
          or posting it, you are giving us the right to show and distribute that
          content both on and off our services. You also give us the right to
          change it or combine it with other content (including paid content),
          for any purpose, without needing to get your agreement. You are not
          entitled to any payment from us for any use of your user content. You
          must therefore take care not to upload or post anything which is
          confidential, commercially sensitive, valuable or which you or someone
          else would not want shared (for example, personal secrets or
          patentable ideas). We will always try to credit user content
          accurately; if we fail to do so, you can contact us and ask us to
          correct it. We are allowed to use any feedback, ideas or suggestions
          in user content, without restriction.
